# data-wrangling

In this project, I performed data cleaning in python and created cvs files withe the cleaned data. Then I input the cvs files into database and query the database for the data I need.

I explore the map of San Jose area:
San Jose, CA, USA

https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/san-jose_california/

I just relocated to San Jose and I am very interested in getting to know more about this area. Besides, I also want to contribute to its improvement.
